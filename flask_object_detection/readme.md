# I’ll guide you through creating a Flask web application on Windows that uses a pre-trained object detection model to detect objects in an uploaded image, draw bounding boxes, and classify the objects. We’ll use a pre-trained model from the transformers library (e.g., DETR, a popular object detection model) and OpenCV for drawing bounding boxes. The app will allow users to upload an image, process it, and display the results with bounding boxes and labels.

this app will

* Have a homepage for uploading an image.
* Process the image using a pre-trained DETR model.
* Draw bounding boxes and labels on the image using OpenCV.
* Display the processed image with detected objects.
